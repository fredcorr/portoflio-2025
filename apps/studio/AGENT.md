# Sanity Studio Agent Rules

This workspace is a Sanity Studio project (schemas, GROQ, previews).

## Schema rules

- Reuse existing document/object types before creating new ones
- Follow established naming conventions for:
  - schema names (`name`)
  - titles (`title`)
  - field names (consistent casing and semantics)
- Prefer `object` types for reusable field groups and reference them across schemas
- Add validation to critical fields (required, min/max, URL/email formats, etc.)
- Keep schema definitions small and composable:
  - extract repeated field sets into their own files
- Any schema change must consider impact on `web/` queries and types

## Shared types between Studio and Web

- When a schema shape changes, ensure shared frontend types are updated (or new shared types are created)
- Prefer deriving/reusing types from the Studio schema conventions rather than inventing parallel shapes

## GROQ querying rules

- Prefer small, composable GROQ fragments for repeated selections
- Always select only what the frontend needs (avoid over-fetching)
- For references:
  - resolve references explicitly with `->` when required by the UI
  - avoid deep expansions unless necessary
- Be explicit about language/locale fields if content is localized (don’t assume defaults)
- Keep queries stable: avoid relying on implicit ordering unless explicitly set

## Preview / Presentation rules

- If the project uses Presentation/Preview mode:
  - Keep preview URL logic centralized (e.g., a single config/module)
  - Avoid hardcoding hostnames; use env vars
  - Prefer token-based or draft-mode aware preview flows
- Preview must support drafts:
  - queries should be able to return draft content when in preview mode
  - avoid caching behavior that prevents draft visibility

## Plugin rules

- Do not add new Sanity plugins without checking peer dependency compatibility
  - especially `@sanity/ui` major version alignment
- Prefer official Sanity plugins or well-maintained community plugins
- If a plugin is incompatible, propose a local/custom implementation rather than forcing peer overrides

## Studio developer experience

- Keep Desk Structure / Structure Builder organized:
  - group related document types
  - avoid duplicating entries
- Keep schema exports deterministic and maintainable
- Dashboard widgets live in `apps/studio/dashboard` and the dashboard tool must remain the first plugin so Studio loads with operational context. Add new widgets there and keep them lightweight (fetch only what is required).
